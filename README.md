# Simple Betting Smart Contract

Created this repository to demonstrate a basic betting use case of smart contract. Essentially, 
- 1 Judge
- 2 Players 

are required to initialize this contract. Upon initialization, players need to put in their bet (there's a minimum bet). After that, the judge will announce a winner between the 2 players. 
Finally, the winner can withdraw the whole pool.
